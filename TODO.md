# Deferred work ledger

- [x] **Prefill mm_id kernel (biggest perf item)** — DONE. Vendored ggml's
  two-pass token→expert row-map kernels (`src/ops/mm_id.metal`, runtime-compiled
  via `src/ops/pipelines.rs`); `FusedExperts::forward` uses mm_id for seq>=32,
  mv_id below. Prefill ~60 → ~188 tok/s (3.1x): classic simdgroup port first
  (~151), then the cooperative-tensor `matmul2d` path (now default, ~188). Still
  short of the fork's ~361 pp512 — remaining gap is surrounding candle dispatch
  overhead, not the matmul (see profile below). Follow-ups:
  - [x] **mm_id tile precision — RESOLVED**: f32 tiles (`_hp`) are the default;
    `LAGUNA_MM_ID_F16=1` selects the f16 variant for A/B vs the future tensor-path
    port. f32 tiles removed the f16 operand rounding (oracle rel 2.6e-4 → 1.94e-7,
    ~1330x, at ~0 throughput cost). The residual model-level drift is tiled f32
    K-accumulation ORDER, not precision — fork-equivalent (the fork's tensor-path
    prefill is ~0.9962 raw and fails the strict 0.999 gate the same way). code-
    short cosines vs Reference by config: mm_id hp glue-off (shipped default)
    0.99687 top-1 268; mm_id hp with the (now-removed) rescale glue 0.99694 top-1
    350; both are a legit near-tie there (reference 350/268 margin 0.319 < 0.5),
    so the mm tier passes either. docs/parity.md §3b documents the two-tier gate:
    strict cos>=0.999 for mv_id/decode, fork-equivalence
    (cos>=0.995 + top-1 match-or-near-tie) for mm_id prefill.
  - [x] **Cooperative-tensor mm_id path PORTED** (the fork's Metal-4 `matmul2d`
    fast path, `kernel_mul_mm_id_t` in mm_id.metal). It is now the DEFAULT prefill
    variant. Probe (mm_id.rs `tensor_matmul2d_probe`) confirmed `<metal_tensor>` +
    `mpp::tensor_ops::matmul2d` compile under candle's default options on the M5.
    Prefill: 151 -> 188 tok/s @925-tok chunk (+24%), 142 -> 157 @4230 (+10%);
    decode unchanged (mv_id). Still short of the fork's ~361 pp512 (see profile
    below). Parity: fork-equivalent mm tier (cos 0.99699 top-1 268), passes; the
    tensor path agrees with the classic-f16 path to 4.4e-7 (per-matmul).
    Runtime-selectable variants (cached env, `ops::MmVariant`):
      - default: tensor f16 tiles (`_t`) — fastest (188), f16-operand, needs rescale.
      - `LAGUNA_MM_ID_TENSOR_HP=1`: tensor f32 tiles (`_t_hp`) — float `matmul2d`
        DOES compile and is f32-precise (1.94e-7/matmul), but SLOWER at model scale
        (163 tok/s: double-width tiles cost more than the rescale they save) and
        still mm-tier at model scale (tiled drift, 0.99687), so not the default.
      - `LAGUNA_MM_ID_CLASSIC=1`: classic f32 simdgroup tiles (`_hp`), 151 tok/s.
      - `LAGUNA_MM_ID_F16=1`: classic f16 simdgroup tiles.
  - [ ] **Remaining gap to the fork's ~361 pp512** — the mm itself is 2 dispatches
    (map0 + matmul2d) per projection and is well-amortized in prefill; the ~188 vs
    361 gap is the ~50 surrounding candle dispatches/MoE+attn layer (route/sigmoid/
    argsort/gather, the ~6-op L2 rescale glue, silu*mul, combine, shared expert,
    and the attention chain) that ggml fuses into far fewer, plus candle per-op
    overhead. The rescale glue is NOT the bottleneck (tensor-hp has none yet is
    slower). Next lever: fuse the MoE route+glue+combine (bit-identical-to-candle
    constraint from the router-cascade lesson) and/or reduce candle dispatch count.
- [ ] **Decode kernel work** — 12.5 -> 13.5 tok/s after glue removal; fork is
  18.1 @512ctx. Per-token budget (2026-07-22, ~512 ctx). FFN sweep (80.0 ms
  total): routed mv_id gate/up/down gather 18.4 ms; routing+combine 4.3 ms;
  rescale glue 3.1 ms (now removed by default); shared expert 1.3 ms; non-FFN
  52.9 ms. Attention sub-sweep (76.9 ms total): attention all-48-layers 50.9 ms
  (66%), of which the sdpa core is only 2.3 ms and the ~24 non-sdpa dispatches/
  layer (q/k/v/g projections, QK-norm, rope, f16 casts, 3x transpose-contiguous,
  cache append, softplus gate, o_proj) are ~48.6 ms; lm_head 6.5 ms; norms+
  sampler+embedding+residuals ~19.5 ms. STORY: death-by-dispatch — sdpa math is
  cheap, the per-layer dispatch overhead around it dominates.
  - [x] **Rescale glue removed from the default path** — the L2 rescale only
    guarded the f16 activation cast in the mm_id f16-tile kernel (opt-in
    `LAGUNA_MM_ID_F16`, staged as half). The default down paths never cast the
    activation to f16: mv_id reads f32 and accumulates f32 (candle
    quantized.metal kernel_mul_mv_q{4,6}_K_f32_impl :4889/4930, :5188/5225);
    mm_id-hp stages src1 as float. So the glue is skipped by default (kept only
    when `LAGUNA_MM_ID_F16`). +8% decode (12.5 -> 13.5), prefill ~149 -> 157.
    Verified: no inf/nan on code/mixed/long-text (609) prefill or greedy decode;
    strict mv tier 0.99906 (>=0.999), mm tier 0.99687; the code fixture's 350/268
    is a genuine near-tie (mv gap 0.16, mm gap 0.23), mixed/long are decisive 350.
  - [x] **Fused-activation kernels RETIRED (both) — LESSON: the MoE router is a
    chaos amplifier for activation-path rounding.** Two vendored kernels were
    built and removed: (a) a fused silu/mul/L2/rescale kernel whose f32 L2
    reduction-order differed from candle's by ~1e-6, and (b) a plain elementwise
    silu*mul kernel differing by ~1e-7 (division vs candle's multiply-by-
    reciprocal). Both were per-op-correct (end-to-end 1.6e-7/layer vs candle) yet
    cascaded through the router — a ~1e-6 activation nudge flips near-tie expert
    selections in later layers — to 1.3e-3..1.5e-3 final-logit divergence, under
    the strict gate. CONSTRAINT for future kernel work: do NOT reimplement any op
    upstream of the router (activation, norm, router logits) unless it is
    BIT-IDENTICAL to candle; post-router ops (down output, lm_head) are safe to
    fuse (no cascade). The glue-removal win needed no kernel — it just dropped the
    now-unnecessary rescale and kept candle's silu*mul.
  - [ ] **Top decode lever: fuse the attention per-layer dispatch chain.** The
    ~48.6 ms of non-sdpa attention overhead (~24 dispatches x 48 layers) is the
    prize. Fuse QK-norm+transpose+rope+f16-cast into one kernel and drop the 3
    transpose-contiguous copies; possibly fuse the softplus-gate+o_proj tail.
    sdpa (2.3 ms) is fine — leave it. lm_head (6.5 ms) is a single vocab matmul,
    minor. mv_id routed gather (18.4 ms) — vendor ggml's mv_id N_R0/N_SG geometry
    — is the concrete FFN-side secondary.
- [ ] **Track B dumps for text-mixed / long-swa** — the full-logit reference-vs-
  fused gate ran only on code-short (greedy covers the other two fixtures);
  generate the remaining dumps if fused ever changes.
- [ ] **ref-dump.sh greedy oracle** — still calls `llama-cli -st -no-cnv`, which
  applies the chat template; swap to the llama-server /completion token-array
  method documented in docs/parity.md.
- [ ] **KV-cache reuse across chat turns** — the REPL re-prefills the whole
  conversation each turn (correct but O(n²) over a long chat); reuse the cache for
  the common prefix instead.
- [ ] **Steady-state prefill timing** — the first forward folds in the one-time
  Metal weight upload, so reported prefill tok/s is misleading; add a warm-up
  forward before timing (or report load-adjusted numbers).
- [ ] **Fine-grained parity taps** — model.rs captures layer-level residual taps
  only; AttnBlock/MoeBlock expose no sub-node intermediates (Qcur_rope,
  attn_gated, ffn_moe_out, …), limiting first-divergence bisection to layer
  granularity. Add hooks if a real divergence ever needs sub-layer localization.

Items deliberately out of v1 scope. Append as new deferrals come up during
implementation — never silently drop scope.

- [ ] **DFlash speculative decoding** — trained drafter at `poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash`
  (BF16 GGUF already in `models/`). Drafter consumes residual-stream taps from target
  layers (`t_layer_inp[il]`, `t_h_nextn` in the fork's laguna.cpp); `model.rs` keeps
  per-layer residual capture hooks feasible for this. Biggest post-v1 perf lever.
- [ ] **HTTP server** (OpenAI-compatible /v1/chat/completions) so coding agents can
  connect; v1 is CLI-only per scope decision.
- [ ] **Self-quantized Q5/Q6 tier** — official GGUF repo only ships Q4_K_M (75.2GB),
  Q8_0 (127.7GB, exceeds 128GB RAM) and F16 (235GB) + imatrix. A Q6_K (~97GB) built
  with the fork's `llama-quantize` from F16 + the published imatrix would be the true
  "largest quant that fits" (needs raised `iogpu.wired_limit_mb` and capped context).
- [ ] **min-p sampling** — generation_config defaults min_p=0 so v1 omits it;
  candle's LogitsProcessor lacks it (would be a custom sampler stage).
- [ ] **Batching** — v1 is deliberately batch=1 (single-user local inference).
- [ ] **Tool-call / reasoning stream parsing** — emitting structured `<tool_call>` /
  `<think>` blocks as parsed events instead of raw text (needed for the server).
  Also inbound: `chat::Message` has no assistant tool-call variant and no tools-list
  header rendering, so the template's tool branches are currently unreachable.
- [ ] **Tokenizer from GGUF metadata** — `LagunaTokenizer::from_gguf` intentionally
  errors ("pass tokenizer.json via --tokenizer"); reconstructing byte-level BPE +
  the 70-entry added vocab from `tokenizer.ggml.*` arrays wasn't worth it while
  tokenizer.json ships with the checkpoint. Revisit if we want single-file UX.
- [ ] **1M-context tuning** — the official GGUF is a 256k conversion (YaRN factor 32,
  `laguna.context_length=262144`); the HF checkpoint config claims 1M via factor 128
  (net mscale 1+0.1·ln(factor) either way). Going past 256k means overriding the rope
  scaling at load (and ~48GB f16 full-attn KV at 1M). v1 caps max_ctx at 32768.
- [ ] **Sampling-defaults discrepancy** — the GGUF metadata carries
  `general.sampling.temp=0.7, top_p=0.9` while generation_config.json says
  temp 1.0 / top_k 20 / top_p 1.0. v1 follows generation_config; revisit if outputs
  seem off-distribution.
